# Challenge-01

In this challenge I refactored the code of a marketing agency page to make it more accessible. 

The application includes semantic html.
The application includes links to the sections on the page.
The application includes elements that follow a logical structure 
The application is organized in sequential order
The application includes images and descriptions of the services offered by the agency. 



This application is designed to be easily accessible and to be optimized for search engines.
